# student-debt-proj
This project aims at looking into the factors contributing to the increase in student debt and its effects on the likelihood of paying back their debt. First, the project examines the following possible contributing factors for an increase in student debt: the amount of tuition and additional fees students are charged with, which institution and what field of study they join,  the amount of federal and provincial loan available for the program they joined and the amount of non-tuition revenue institutions get. Second, the project examines whether the studentsâ€™ struggle  to pay back their loan is the result of an increase in debt or other factors such as unemployment and growth in income.
